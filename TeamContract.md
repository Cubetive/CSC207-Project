# Team Contract

## Purpose of this Contract

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

* Our team is dedicated to using Discord as a primary means of communication.

* Each team member is expected to respond to another member's message within 1 day if the content of the message is considered urgent (i.e. by using the keyword "ASAP"). Otherwise, it is expected to respond within 3 days maximum.

* Teammates should communicate any urgencies in their personal and/or university life to ensure adaptability and team awareness. For example, if a teammate has an exam and needs to delay the deadline, or if they are ill and have to miss the lecture, etc.

* As an inclusive and professional team, every team member is expected to remain respectful to others (no personal insults), create constructive arguments and criticisms, and retain professionalism within team discussions. We must actively listen to each other's thoughts, looking at ideas/opinions with an open and clear mind (no bias).

### Attendance and Participation

* All members are expected to attend all scheduled lectures and tutorials unless illness or an emergency occurs.

* In case of an emergency, if a team member is unable to attend the tutorial and/or lecture, they are expected to notify the entire team in the group chat and state their reasoning.

* During team activities, all team members are expected to engage and contribute ideas in the discussion.

* Members must not make constant excuses and delay deadlines for no clear reason. They must work with passion and commitment to the project, ensuring their best possible work goes out.

## Decision Making

* For general purposes, decisions will be made based on team consensus (in and out of class).
  - If no consensus can be reached, a poll will be conducted in the group chat, where the majority of votes rules.

---
## Conflict resolution

* If a conflict occurs, one (or more) team member(s) becomes the mediator-
  - The mediator(s) will listen to both parties' issues with an open mind and attempt to reach a compromise (providing appropriate reasoning).
  - If no resolution has yet been reached, the entire team is required to consult either a TA or an instructor regarding the conflict.

## Accountability

* Every team member is expected to complete their share of the work within the given deadline.

* Every team member must be timely and clear in their communication and participate in group discussions. 

* If a team member requires any form of assistance, they are expected to seek out another team member and/or a TA/an instructor.

* Failure to participate persistently and meet expectations may result in lower peer evaluation scores.

* All members shall agree to provide honest and fair responses in the peer evaluations.
